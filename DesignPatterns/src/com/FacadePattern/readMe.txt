Facade Pattern provides us an interface to all the abstract objects of the sub systems.
This will make it easy to get all the related objects for that particular Module.
This reduces dependencies on outside code on inner workings of libriary, thus allowing more flexibility in developing the system.
Wrap a poorly designed collection of APIs with a single well-designed API.
We can write our expose methods with functionality using the objects.
